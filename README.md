<h3>About Me | </h3>
<div style="color: gray; font-family: sans-serif;">
  <p>
   I am a Computer Science Engineering student developing practical skills in AI, machine learning, and data science through hands-on projects and structured learning. I focus on breaking down problems, identifying patterns, and refining solutions to improve clarity and efficiency. Alongside this, I am learning blockchain development and strengthening problem-solving skills through DSA in C++. My approach to learning is driven by practice, logical thinking, and continuous improvement, helping me build a strong foundation in core computer science.  </p>
